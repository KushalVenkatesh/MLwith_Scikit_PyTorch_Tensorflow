# MLwith_Scikit_PyTorch_Tensorflow
Following the "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-learn &amp; TensorFlow" O'Reilly book by Aurelien Geron, I am going to present each exercise in 4 ways: basic Pyhton, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.   This is will both be practice for me and a great future reference for others trying to learn the differences between each approach.
